# Progress

## What Works
- The initial project structure and memory bank documentation are in place.
- The core concepts of the project are documented in `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## What's Left to Build
- The actual frontend application code (React components, etc.).
- The `cline.rules` file.
- Integration with GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1 (Setup):** In Progress.
- **Phase 2 (Development):** Not Started.
- **Phase 3 (Deployment):** Not Started.

## Known Issues
- None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision was made to use React with Vite as the frontend framework for this project setup guide. This provides a modern, fast development experience.
