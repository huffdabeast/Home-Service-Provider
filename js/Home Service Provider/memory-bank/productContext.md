# Product Context

## Problem
Developers, especially those working in teams or with AI assistants like Cline, need a structured and consistent way to manage project setup and context. Without a standardized process, projects can become disorganized, leading to confusion, duplicated effort, and a steep learning curve for new contributors.

## Solution
This project establishes a comprehensive, repeatable template for setting up a modern web application. It covers everything from the local file structure to deployment, ensuring that all project stakeholders (human or AI) have a clear and consistent understanding of the project's architecture, state, and goals.

## User Experience
- **For Developers:** A clear, logical, and easy-to-follow setup process that minimizes ambiguity and accelerates development.
- **For Cline:** A reliable "memory bank" that provides all necessary context to understand the project, assist effectively, and maintain continuity between sessions.
