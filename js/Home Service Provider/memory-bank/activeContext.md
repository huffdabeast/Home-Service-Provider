# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on the initial setup of the project structure and documentation. This involves creating the necessary directories and files for the Cline memory bank, `cline.rules`, and preparing for integration with external services like GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's goals and requirements.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the problem, solution, and user experience.

## Next Steps
- Create the remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Create the `cline.rules` file.
- Document the steps for GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel integration.
