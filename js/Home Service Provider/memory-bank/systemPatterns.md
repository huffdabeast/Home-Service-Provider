# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The application will follow a standard client-server architecture:
- **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte). This will be determined in `techContext.md`.
- **Backend:** A serverless backend provided by Supabase, which includes a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and auto-generated APIs.
- **Deployment:** The frontend will be deployed to Vercel, which will handle continuous integration and deployment from the GitHub repository.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Monorepo vs. Polyrepo:** This project will use a single repository (monorepo) to house both the frontend code and all project documentation, simplifying management and versioning.
- **State Management:** To be decided based on the chosen frontend framework.
- **Styling:** To be decided based on the chosen frontend framework (e.g., CSS-in-JS, utility-first CSS like Tailwind CSS).

## Component Relationships
- The frontend application will communicate with the Supabase backend via its RESTful or GraphQL API for data persistence and user authentication.
- Vercel will be connected to the GitHub repository, automatically deploying new changes pushed to the main branch.
